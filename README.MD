# Comp3074 Project

A React Native application built with Expo, featuring navigation, maps, and a custom user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended): https://nodejs.org/
- npm (installed with Node.js) or yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/
- Expo CLI: https://expo.dev/cli
- Android Studio (for Android emulation): https://developer.android.com/studio
- Xcode (for iOS simulation, macOS only): https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

## Getting Started

1. Install Expo CLI globally on your computer by running:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
2. Install Expo CLI globally on your computer by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bycold1/restaurant_app.git
```
Replace yourusername with the appropriate GitHub username.

3. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd comp3074project
```
4. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Alternatively, if you're using yarn, run:
```bash
yarn
```
5. Start the development server:
```bash
expo start
```
This command will open a new browser window with the Expo Developer Tools. From there, you can run the app on an Android or iOS simulator, or on a physical device using the Expo Go app.

To run the app on a simulator or emulator, you'll need to have either Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS) installed on your computer. In the Expo Developer Tools, click "Run on Android device/emulator" or "Run on iOS simulator" to start the app on the respective simulator or emulator.

To run the app on a physical device, install the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device. Scan the QR code displayed in the Expo Developer Tools or terminal with the Expo Go app. The app will then load on your device.
